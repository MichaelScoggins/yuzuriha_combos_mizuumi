## yuzuriha combo list (UNI2)

my markdown conversion of the terrific combo guide from

> https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Yuzuriha/Combos

while struggling to internalize the above guide for Yuzu in my attempt to become proficient with her, i made it easier to read (for myself at least)

this "project" is merely an exercise in improving readability as i attempt to internalize every combo in this impressive list. it is also going to reflect my (lack of) proficiency in markdown.

i figured it could help someone else, so here it is. it also serves as a nice reference for myself in the highly likely event that i end up the only human to benefit from it in any way. changes are mostly formatting/highlighting-related, but I also will possibly add notes for further clarity on anything which confuses me too much

if the original author/site of the combo guide has any problems or issues with this repo, i will immediately remove it

it would seem there is a section on the original guide "Normals" which is empty? so i did not include it. i think they started a "far range combos" section with intent of including stance starters and normal starters (presumably 6X) but never got around to it :disappointed:
