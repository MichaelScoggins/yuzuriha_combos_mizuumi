# yuzuriha combo list (UNI2)

> my markdown conversion (with notes) of the terrific combo guide from

> https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Yuzuriha/Combos

## intro

as a new Yuzu player completely overwhelmed with her skill floor but thinking her iaido style is just too damned cool, i decided i would struggle to internalize the above guide for Yuzu in my attempt to become proficient with her, and i wanted to make it easier to read for myself

this "project" is merely an exercise in improving readability as i attempt to internalize every combo in this impressive list. it is also going to reflect my (lack of) proficiency in markdown

i figured it could help someone else, but it's mostly for personal reference/study. changes are mostly formatting/highlighting-related, but I also will ~~possibly~~ add notes for further clarity on anything which ~~confuses~~ confused me too much

for context, i recently finished performing these combos from the left side of the screen and was confused by many things trying to perform them without video reference, and this project represents me going through all of them again from the right side of the screen this time. for clarification, "going through them" means being able to perform each one consistently, using the original damage value as my only reference to know if i am performing it correctly. i will use footnotes any time i explicitly add or change anything. i also am apparently going to notate a bunch of combos with additional tips for performing them and address the many damage discrepancies i am encountering

if the original author/site of the combo guide has any problems or issues with this repo, i will immediately remove it

it would seem there is a section on the original guide "Normals" that is empty? so i did not include it. i think they started a "far range combos" section with intent of including both stance starters and normal starters (presumably 6X) but never got around to the latter :disappointed:. i've also reordered the sections a bit

i also feel it's important to note that staying in stance actually typically decreases damage output, while making it usually easier to execute the combo, allowing longer holds without exiting stance. while the dmg outputs are similar, it is important to note while using the listed damage as reference

## _Standard Enders_

1. `66B` **Midscreen**

   - Basic midscreen knockdown option. Useful if you'd rather keep the opponent close than get some extra damage and meter. Knockdown depends on height/proration, may still allow air tech.

   ***

2. `66B > 236A~B~A~C/236B~A~B > 236A+D` **Midscreen**

   - Primary midscreen ender. Adds damage, creates space, and knocks the opponent high into the air for good frame advantage. The two variants are interchangeable, with one or the other doing slightly more damage depending on the route. `B~A~B` is better if only `236A` was used prior, `A~B~A~C` is better if `236B` was used prior or the combo is extremely heavily scaled, and the two are very close in damage if both were used.
   - May need to delay the first `236X` slightly for proper height in some cases; delaying the `236A+D` slightly creates more space after the combo. Forward teching sets up left/right mix if `236A+D` is not delayed.
   - `66B` is sometimes replaced by some portion of the `4C 2C 4B` sequence, at minimum incorporating `2C`.

   ***

3. `66B/2C > 236B > 6C > dl6B > dl6A > 236A+D` **Midscreen**

   - "Kiri ender". Longer delay on `6B`, then a short delay on `6A` to push the opponent forward enough for `236AD` to connect. More damage than repeated `236X` slashes, but also much more precise and strict on proration/height. Unlikely to work on routes that incur SMP or if the opponent is relatively high up at the `236B` hit. Omitting `6C` or `6B` can sometimes make the ender possible/more consistent for some damage lost.
   - Combos where this ender is possible will have a footnote with damage and any important details.

   ***

4. `66C` **Corner**

   - Basic corner knockdown ender. Hard knockdown if hit low enough, meaning the opponent is unable to air tech forward. Leaves you slightly plus at `5B` range. Generally not used midscreen because it pushes the opponent much further away than `66B` without the damage of the `236X enders`, but in the corner the resulting spacing is much closer. Landing after leaves Yuzuriha around +8 at `5B` range, or she can cancel into `j421A > j214A~D` or `j214C`.

   ***

5. `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D` **Corner**
   - Damage ender for the corner. Nets a left-right mixup if the opponent airtechs forward. Can add `236B` beforehand for slightly more damage but no mixup.
   - Some corner routes pull the opponent out of the corner. In this case, go for the midscreen ender instead.
   ***

## _Metered Enders_

1. `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D > 236C/214C/IW`

   _cost: 100/200 EXS_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Midscreen meter dump. `236C` retains the strong frame advantage of the `236X` enders and adds about 500 damage. `214C` does more damage for worse oki.
   - `IW` is interchangeable with all EX enders as desired and able. For `IWEX`, do `236A~B~A > IWEX` instead.

   ***

2. `66B > 236A > 214B > j214C > 421A~D`

   _100 EXS_ **|** **Corner**

   - Corner meter dump. `236B~A 214B j214C+D` can squeeze out a little more damage to close rounds.

   ***

3. `CVO, 66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D > IW`

   _100 EXS, Vorpal_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - `Low meter CVO` ender. Skip to `IW` after `236BA` in the corner.
   - For all `CVO` enders, you can start from any previous meterless ender and `CVO` immediately after the last attack that is not D-paired.

   ***

4. `CVO, TK j.214C > IW`

   _200 EXS, Vorpal_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - `High health CVO` ender. Delay the `j.214C` slightly to ensure `IW` connects in the corner. `214C` also works, but is slightly slower and thus slightly more meter depletes before you can `IW`. If health is <30% and you have at least 110 meter, you can do this route with `IWEX` instead of `IW`. Sideswaps, so you may want to use `236C` instead of `j214C` if the combo won't kill.

   ***

5. `CVO, 66B > 236C > 236A > 214C > IWEX`

   _200 EXS, Vorpal_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Low health `CVO` ender, requires full meter before `CVO`.

   ***

> Routes are often applicable to many different starters with minimal changes. `B/C` normals, `6X`, and `236X` can generally use the same routes at close range with minimal adjustments, or even use `A` starter routes. Combos for lower quality starters (`throw` < `assault` < `A starters`; `6X starters`) will also work on better starters (`B/C normals`; `236X starters`)

## _Starter Combos_

1. > `2A > 5C > 2C > 236B > 6C > 6B > 214A~D/214B+D > `

   > `2C > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _2974 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Very consistent route for normal and `Assault` starters that works both **midscreen** and in **corner**. Also works from `throw` if you skip to `2C`. Use `214A` to stay on the same side of your opponent, `214B~D` to sideswap. _Adjust the ender if in_ **corner**.

   ***

2. > `A+D~2, `

   > `5C > dl.2C > 236B > 6C > dl.6B > 214A~D/214B+D > `

   > `dl.66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _1819 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Slight upgrade to the previous combo. Delaying `2C` is needed after throw since `5C` will then OTG launch. Getting comfortable with `dl6B` and the `66B` ender is helpful for later routes.

   ***

## _214X/j214X_

1. > `214X~D/j214X~D, `

   > `2A > 5C > j2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A > dl 9D, j.B > j.C, `[^footnote1]

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236AD`

   _3219 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Most reliable **confirm** for Yae Ichirin starters when exiting stance. `214X` doesn't give you enough frame advantage to **confirm** with anything better, and `j214X` optimizations are height dependent.

   ***

2. > `j214X(~D, 66B) > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `2C > 5C > j2C > jB > jC, `[^footnote2]

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236AD`

   _3275 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Better **confirm** for `TK j214X~D`. If you remain in stance and **confirm** with `(6X > dl) 236A` this also works from grounded `214X`.

   ***

3. > `j214X(~D, 66B) > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `5C > j2C > jB > jC, `[^footnote3]

   > `66B > 236B > 6C > 214B > 421A`

   _3447 dmg_[^footnote3] **|** **Corner**

   - Better corner **confirm** for `TK j214X~D`. If you remain in stance and **confirm** with `(6X > dl) 236A` this also works from grounded `214X`.

   ***

## _Air-to-Air_

1. > `jB > j6C > j236B > dl j214A, `[^fn4]

   > `2C > 5C > j2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236AD`

   _3045 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Standard air to air `jB` hit combo. If you can get in range to avoid distance proration, the combo does _3167_[^fn4]

   ***

2. > `jB > j6C > j421C > 2FF, `[^fn5]

   > `2C > 236A > 9D > j2[C], `

   > `5C > 236B > 6C > dl 6B > 214A, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236AD`

   _3238 dmg_[^fn5] **|** 1 GRD[^fn5] **|** **Midscreen**

   - "DBZ" style air to air combo. `2FF` is the easiest way to consistently stabilize the combo[^fn5]

   ***

## _**Close Range Combos**_

"Close Range" routes encompass anything where spacing allows routing into `236A 9D icj2C` and cover routes commonly used in **pressure**, defense, scrambles, and close range **punish** situations. "Far Range" extends from this point (about max `5B` range) outwards. These routes are staples for neutral conversions and stance **pressure**.

### _Throw_

Yuzuriha's combo throw input works with any down input, but is notated here as `A+D~2`.

1. > `A+D~2, `

   > `2B > A+B`

   _1533 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Quick route for extra GRD and nearly as much damage as the non-combo throw. `2B` is the best you can do from throw while still building GRD on `A+B`.

   ***

2. > `A+D~2, `

   > `66C(1) > j236A > j6B > dlj6C > j214A > 8, jC > jB, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _1902 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Midscreen throw route. `66C(1) > j236A > j6B > dlj6C > j214A > 8 > jC > jB` is an important combo piece in Yuzuriha's higher damage combos.
   - _Kiri ender: 1920_ as `236B > 6C > dl6B > 6A`. Due to teching out after `6a`, `236AD` followup is not possible in this throw combo.

   ***

3. > `A+D~2, (6B >) 6C > 236A > 9D, dljC, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214B~D, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _1841 dmg (1882)_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Alternate throw route with better carry. `6B` adds damage, but also makes the route more difficult and requires delaying `236A`.

   ***

4. > `A+D~2, 66C(1) > j236B > 7/8D, icj2C, `

   > `2C > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A, `

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D`

   _1972 dmg_ **|** **Corner**

   - Jump cancel has to be 7 or 8 to avoid awkward sideswaps. Don't D-cancel the `214A`; this both sets up a good timing for either `66B` or `66C`. D-cancel isn't required on the `8D` either.

   ***

5. > `2AA > A+D~2, `

   > `5C > 236B > 6C > (dl6B >) 214A > `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _1447 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - For when the opponent gets hit by 1-2 `A` normals when going for TRM. The extra hits before the throw heavily prorate the combo so full throw routes won't work. Omit `6B` in corner and change ender accordingly.

   ***

### _Assault_

1. > `6D, j2C, 2A > 5C > 2C > 236A > 9D, dljC, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214B~D, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _2864 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Confirming with `2A` instead of `5A` adds over 100 damage.

   ***

2. > `6D, j2C, 2A > 5C > 2C > 236B~A > dl9D, jB > jC, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214B~D, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _2934 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Slight damage gain by adding `236B` and `jB`, but you need to delay the `236A` jump cancel.

   ***

3. > `6D, j2C, 2A > 5C > 236A > 9D, dljC, `

   > `66B > 236B > 421A~D, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6B > j214A, 66C`

   _2740 dmg_ **|** **Corner**

   - Adding `jB` after `236A` does slightly more damage but requires a delayed jump after `236A`.

   ***

### _A starters_

1. > `2A/5A > 5C/2C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `2C/5C > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A/214B+D, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3246 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Mainstay UNISC route and a key upgrade over Assault routing. `214A` stays on the same side, while `214B+D` sideswaps. Change the ender if in corner.
   - `ICj2C` is more strict about starters than previous routes. `5A` must immediately combo into a `B` or `C` normal then `236A`, while `2AA > B or C normal > 236A and 2AA > 2B > 2C/5B > 236A` are possible. Anything more will drop. Less filler is better for damage. `B/C` starters will work more consistently but should still **confirm** to `236A` as quickly as possible.
   - Try to not repeat use of `5C/2C` for max damage, but `2C > 236B > etc` is easier to start with and will work regardless.

   ***

2. > `2A/5A > 5C/2C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214A~D, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3077 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - The pre-SC BNB. Still offers decent corner carry. Also possible as `dlj236A > j6C > j214B~D`.

   ***

3. > `2A > 5C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `tk236A~B~D, 2C > 236B > (6C > dl) 214B, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _3219 dmg (3326)_ **|** **Corner**

   - Corner TK route, sideswaps then crosses over the opponent to put them back in corner. Land and rejump into the `j236A`. Omit `6C` for `2AA` or `5A` starters or if **confirm**ed into `2C`.

   ***

### _B/C Starters_

Also includes close range `6X` and `236X` starters. `2C` can follow these (and the above) combos by **confirm**ing into `236A`, or potentially `6B/6C > dl236A` if close enough or in corner.

1. > `5B > 5C/2C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `66C(1) > j236A > j6B > dlj6C > j214A > 8, jC > jB `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3583 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Adds some damage and carry on better starters. Can work from `2A > 5C` but requires an extremely difficult and impractical 1f delay on `j.C > j.B`.
   - You can also **confirm** into this route after `6C~D` with `66B > 236A`
   - _Kiri ender: 3677 damage_, `5B` or better starters only. `2C` pickup into this route with kiri ender is great for starters like `4B` parry or `2FF`, getting nearly optimal damage with less effort on the **confirm**.

   ***

2. > `5C > 236A~D, `

   > `66C(1) > j236B > j6C > j6A > dlj214B, `

   > `5B/5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3575 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Alternative, **punish** route with better carry for slightly less damage. Use `5C` to relaunch on `non-5C starters`. Delay the airstring as late into your jump as possible to give yourself more time for the `66B` link.
   - _Kiri ender: 3669 damage_. Not D-canceling `j214B` helps significantly with height management. `CH 236A` can do `2C > 5C > airstring > kiri ender` for _3681 damage_. `CH j236A` gets the same route into `66B 236A~B~6C 6A 236A+D` for _3684 dmg_.

   ***

3. > `5C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `j236A > j6C > j6B > j6A > 9D, jB > jC > `

   > `66B > 236B > 6C > 214A, `

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D`

   _3758 dmg_ **|** **Corner**

   - New patch TK routing making use of Yuzuriha's extra jump cancel in combo. Does high damage and builds 1 full bar of meter. The combo can build 100 meter with the starters: `5B (5/2C)`, `4C`, `2C`, `4B` and `CH 2B (5/2C)`.

   ***

### _2C Launch & 5C Anti-Air_

Starters that leave the opponent high off the ground can't easily route into `236A 9D icj2C`, so they use a different set of combos.

1. > `2C > 5C > 236A > w6B/w6C~D, `

   > `9jC > j6B/j6C > j421C > 236A > dl9D, j2C > jB, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214B~D, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3557 dmg_[^1] **|** **Midscreen**

   - "DBZ route", for `2C` hits into a launch. Sideswaps. Ability to `j6B` is height and spacing dependent; `j6C` is safer but generally needs to delay the following `236A`.

   ***

2. > `antiair 5C > jC > j6B/j6C > j421C > 236A > 8D, icj2C, `

   > `2C > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A/214B+D, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _3388 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - New `5C AA` combo, utilizing Yuzu's extra jump cancel for an easier combo. `5C` is a strong enough starter to allow DBZ into `icj2C`, which gets you back to standard routing for better damage. `FF~A` extensions also work.

   ***

3. > `antiair 5C > (dl)236A > w6B/w6C~D, `

   > `9jC > j6B/j6C > j421C > 236A > 8D, icj2C, `

   > `2C > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A/214B+D, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _3444 dmg_[^2] **|** **Midscreen**

   - More difficult **confirm** requiring a whiff cancelled `236A` for the `j.C` connection. This does slightly more damage than the above `AA 5C` combo. [^3]

   ***

4. > `2C > 5C > j2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236B > 421A~D > `

   > `66C > j236A > j6B > j214A, `

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D`

   _3440 dmg_ **|** **Corner**

   - Simple corner `2C 5C` **confirm**

   ***

5. > `2C > 5C > 236A > w6C~D, `

   > `jC > j6B > dlj236B > 8D, icj2C, `

   > `66B > 236B > 6C > 214A, `

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D`

   _3514 dmg_[^4] **|** **Corner**

   - Stronger corner `2C 5C` **confirm**

   ***

### _Force Function Starter/Extension_

1. > `2A/5A > 5C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `2C/6C > 6A > FF~A~D, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214A~D, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`[^5]

   _3394 dmg_[^6] **|** cost: 1 GRD **|** **Midscreen**

   - `FF~A` extension for damage and carry at the expense of some GRD

   ***

2. > `5B > 5C > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `2C > 236B > 6A > FF~A~D > dl 9, j.B > j.C > `

   > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214A~D, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`[^7]

   _3654 dmg_[^7] **|** 1 GRD **|** meter gain: 101 Opponent: 59 **|** **Midscreen**

   - `FF~A` extension on better starters. Changes to Yuzuriha's character mechanics allow for her to do 2 jump cancels in one combo, allowing her to squeak just enough hits to build 100 meter in a single combo with a low GRD cost

   _3751 dmg (3673)_[^8] **|** 1 GRD **|** **Midscreen**

   - Non-CH `236A` hit **confirm**s for when you hold too long for or are out of range of `66C1` routes. Great damage, carry, and stability vs `non-FF confirms`, so these are a particularly good use of GRD.

   _3440 dmg_ **|** 1 GRD **|** 81 Opp: 45 **|** **Midscreen**

   - Standard `2FF Anti-air combo`. In some cases, it can be difficult to land `2C`. Instead, pick up after `2FF` with `2B > j2C > jB > jC, 66C > j236A > j6C > j214B~D`.[^10]
   - `66B` in ambiguous situations where you aren't sure if `2C`'s forward momentum would cause a whiff.[^10]

   _3052 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Reliable **confirm** when `66C(1)` hits on attempted `66C(1) > j214X` resets in **pressure**

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _3390 dmg_[^12] **|** **Anywhere**

   - Same concepts as the `236A 66C(1) j236A` **punish** route, adapted for `66C(1) starter`.

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _3328 dmg_ **|** **Anywhere**

   - Adaptation of the carry **punish** route for `66C(1)` starter. This is also your optimal **confirm** from `counterhit tk j236A` (_3794_).

   ***

4. > `66C(1) > j236B > j421C > 2FF, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236AD`[^14]

   _3462 dmg_[^14] **|** **Midscreen**

   - Utilizes `2FF` to pick up after `j.236B`, gives both high damage and excellent corner carry

   > `jB > j2C > jC, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`[^15]

   _3274 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - `66C` **confirm** for both/2nd only hit

## **Far Range Combos**

Distance proration and variable number of `214X/j214X` hits may cause damage to vary more from values given here. `236X` base damage also decreases with marks used in stance, so hits later in stance will do less damage.

### _Stance_

1. > `236B~D, 236A/236B > dl214B~D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3009/2716 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Basic `6X/236B` conversion and your go-to combo near max `236B` range.`236A > dl 214B~D` will cover most hits, but near max range you need `236B` instead.
   - `j236B` can also go into any `236B` starter route at heights that will hit standing opponents, but there's a trick: above TK height you'll want to whiff `jA` or `jB` as you fall to reduce landing recovery and then buffer your followup behind that. Use whichever button doesn't correspond to your followup `236X` hit to make things easier.
   - _Kiri ender: 3083/2744 damage_, can get _2798 damage_ on `236B 236B` by changing the ender to `236A 6C`.

   ***

2. > `236B~D, 236A > 421C > dl j214B~D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3184 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Higher damage conversion with less carry. Delay `j214B` slightly to get more hits and higher damage.
   - _Kiri ender: 3365 damage_

   ***

3. > `236B~D, 236A > 421C > (j421B >) j6A > j214A+D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3345 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Optimized midrange damage. Adding `j421B` puts you back on the same side, but makes the combo more difficult[^16]. Omit `2C` if starting with `6A` or `6C`.
   - _Kiri ender: 3304 damage_. Very difficult, requires very clean height management beforehand.[^17]

   ***

4. > `236B~D, dl236A > 421B > dl6A > 214B+D, `[^18]

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _3204 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Sameside alternative to the previous route. Delay both `236A` and `6A` as late as possible so the opponent is low enough for `6A` to connect.

   ***

5. > `236B~D, 236B > 421C > j236B > j214B+D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _2781 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   > `236B~D, 236B > 421B > dl236A > dl214B~D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC,`

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _2739 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Corner carry routes that cover nearly the entire stage. Especially nice on far range `236B` hits when your **back is near (but not in) the corner**.[^19]

   ***

6. > `j236A/j6C > j236B > j214B+D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _3224/2970 dmg_ **|** **Midscreen**

   - Same concept as the ground conversions, but for common air stance attacks. This combo is likely one of your main uses for negative edge D-pairing, so it's a good opportunity to practice that as well.
   - _Kiri ender: 3270/3036_

   ***

7. > `236B~D, 66C(1) > j236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `5C > 236A > 6C > dl6B > 214A/214B+D, `

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D`

   _3490 dmg_ **|** **Corner**

   - Midrange `236B` hits in corner can **confirm** into `66C(1)` for high damage. Use `236A` instead of `236B` later in the combo to avoid SMP. Also works from `6B`, but not `6C`.

   ***

8. > `236B, 421B > 6A > FF~A~D, `[^21]

   > `2C > 236A > dl9D, jB > jC, `

   > `66C > j236A > j6B > j214A, `

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A~D`

   _3296 dmg_ **|** 1 GRD **|** **Back to Corner**

   - `FF~A` **confirm** to sideswap the opponent into corner from any spacing besides point blank. Requires staying in stance after `236B`. _3637 damage_ at close range or on CH.

   ***

### _Stance Super Confirms[^22]_

9. > `236B~D, 236C > 421A > 236B > 214B+D, `

   > `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236AD`

   _3392 dmg_[^23] **|** **Back to Corner**

   ***

   > `236B~D, 236C > 421A > 236B~D, `

   > `236A > 421C > j214B~D,`

   > `5C > dlj2C > jB > jC, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236AD`

   _3341 dmg_ **|** 100 EXS **|** **Back to Corner**

   - Metered **confirm**s for stability on `236B` hits from corner. Will work at any spacing. `236C` is also your go-to **confirm** in this situation if you exit stance after `236B`.[^24]

   ***

10. > `236B~D, 236C > 421B > dl236A > w6C~D, `

    > `j2C > jB > jC, `[^25]

    > `66C > j236A > j6C > j214B~D, `

    > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236AD`

    _3470 dmg_[^25] **|** 100 EXS **|** **Back to Corner**

    - Higher damage metered **confirm** from in corner with excellent carry. `236A` needs to hit high up for `6C` to whiff.

    ***

### _236C_

`236C` is your most damaging starter, works at almost any range, and is faster than some of your best meterless starters. Especially good if starting from 200 so that you can rebuild some meter midcombo, with an additional +25% refund if in Vorpal. `j236C` can follow the `236C` teleport confirms and corner route by utilizing `j421C > 236A, j421C > 2FF` and `j421B > j236A` as appropriate.

1. > `236C > 421B > 2FF > 2C > 236A > 9D > j2[C] > `

   > `66C(1) > j236A > j6B > dl j6C > j214A > 8, jC > jB, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236AD`

   _4134 dmg_ **|** 100 EXS, 1 GRD **|** **Midscreen**

   - Universal `236C` **confirm** for varying ranges. Sideswaps from about 2/3rds screen and closer.

   ***

2. > `236C > 421B > dl6C > dl236A > 9D, icj2C, `[^26]

   > `66C(1) > j236A > j6B > j6C > dlj214A > 8, j.C > j.B, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _4176 dmg_ **|** 100 EXS **|** **Midscreen**

   - GRDless Midscreen **confirm** for varying ranges. Sideswaps from about 2/3rds screen and closer.
   - _Kiri ender: 4241 damage_

   ***

3. > `236C > 421B > 236A~D, `

   > `66C(1) > j236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `5C (> dl2C) > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A/214B+D, `[^27]

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _4064[^27]/4156 dmg_ **|** 100 EXS **|** **Midscreen, Close**

   - High damage midscreen `236C` combo using `421B` sideswap to set up spacing for the midscreen **punish** route. First hit of `214A` whiffs here unless in corner, while `214BD` fully connects for additional damage.

   ***

4. > `236C > 6B > dl236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `66C(1) > j236A > j6B > j6C > dlj214A > 8, j.C > j.B, `

   > `66B > 236B~A~B > 236A+D`

   _4379 dmg_ **|** 100 EXS **|** **Midscreen, Close**

   - Same side `236C` **punish** route for forward carry

   ***

5. > `236C > 421C > j236A > 8D, icj2C, `

   > `2C > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A/214B+D, `

   > `66B > 236A~B~A~C > 236A+D`

   _4029 dmg_[^28] **|** 100 EXS **|** **Midscreen, Far**

   - Far range `236C` conversion BNB via `421C j236A`. `421B` routes are more difficult here[^28] because the opponent passes over Yuzu on the teleport, but `421C` body blocks the opponent to set up a consistent `j236A` hit.

   ***

6. > `236C > 421B > 236A > 9D, icj2C, `

   > `tk j236A > j6B > j6C > j6A > 9D, j.B > j.C, `

   > `66B > 236B > 6C > dl6B > 214A, `[^29]

   > `66B > 236A > 214B > 421A`

   _4539 dmg_ **|** 100 EXS **|** **Corner, Close**

   - Corner TK routing optimization for `236C` starter. `421B` not only moves you into position if starting further away, it makes this route do more damage at close range than skipping to `236A`. Yes, really.

_good luck, future iaido master!_

# Footnotes

[^1]: i am only able to get _3465_ for whatever reason, and `j6C` makes combo impossible for me. you also need to be pretty close for this to work properly
[^2]: _3459_ on `ABAC AD~`; _3435_ on `BAB AD~`. for whatever reason
[^3]: only use when distanced at about one-and-a-half yuzu widths. pretty spacing dependent, with a weird delay, for about 30 extra damage (above combo does _3410_ on `BAB AD~`)--but can help foster a confirm when unsure whether you want to follow up `AA 5C` with a jump
[^4]: i get _3571_ for whatever reason
[^5]: i can only get this combo to work with `j214B~D`, not `j214A~D`--which misses by about half a screen when i try it. even `j214B~D` is a tight pickup. either a typo or i'm missing something
[^6]: `2C` version only gives me _3250_, sometimes _3258_, and `6C` version only _3238_, for whatever reasons. it's possible this combo is missing partially, or else i am totally misunderstanding it. several alternative, similar routes, so i'll just avoid this one for now
[^7]: again, i can only make this work with `j214b`, and it nets me _3658_, for whatever reason
[^8]:
    omitting parenthesized portion requires staying in stance, and nets better dmg at _3755-3759_. delay the `6A` as much as possible, then do `FF~A~D` as fast as possible. at the end, do the `2C > 5C` very fast, then delay the `j2C` as much as possible. weird timing, and still easily misses if not managed up to that point well enough.
    including parenthesized portion nets _3645-3653_. the `66C` is a tight pickup if you do include them

[^9]: i added the `antiair ` to the front of this combo for immediate clarity
[^10]: i found original wording confusing and restructured these notes slightly to make them reflect what i think it means (basically i changed a word, a comma, and a line break)
[^11]: use `214A` up close and `214B` when spaced. delay the `5C` or it whiffs
[^12]: no matter which variant of this combo i perform, i never end up with _3390 dmg_--for whatever reason. `214B` variant nets _3426_ and `214A` nets _3368_ for me
[^13]: you'll also want to delay `j6A`, to most easily prevent sideswap. and you want to use the same rhythm described in [^8] (about the `2C > 5C > j2C` segment), or else you'll whiff the `236A` followup to `66B`. you'll also probably need to wait a tick after the `66B`, so as to not drop the ender. a little tricky but not bad, and very worth the effort. kiri ender: _3378 dmg_
[^14]: sick combo. use `214B~D` for sideswap
[^15]: ender won't work if combo ends up in corner
[^16]: it doesn't really make combo more difficult, once you get the basic rhythm
[^17]: honestly it isn't that hard to hit combo, nor kiri ender
[^18]: it's perplexing that the combo before this is described as so difficult and nothing is mentioned about this one. in my view, this combo is actually the hardest, least consistent out of the entire list. and it does less damage while requiring pretty insane setup and insane delays to get the proper sideswitch, which in my attempts did not guarantee success by any means. ignore this combo and use the one above
[^19]: use the first (`421C`) combo if combo won't end in corner, since its ender won't work there, plus it does more damage. use second (`421B`) combo if you are closer to mid screen and might carry to corner
[^21]: this combo as written does not seem to be possible. however, a way to make it work is by simply changing `FF~A~D` to `2FF` (maybe this is what author intended?), which makes it work perfectly and for more damage... it also does even more damage and becomes yet easier by doing `2C > 5C > dlj2C > jB > jC` instead of the listed `2C > 236A > dl9D, jB > jC`. whether you change this part or not it will still do more damage than listed: _3610_ if you swap both, _3530_ if you only do the `2FF` swap
[^22]: added this section to more easily find super confirms, and moved combo #10 to right before this section (now #8), since it is not a super confirm
[^23]: _kiri ender: 3420 dmg_
[^24]: first combo is easier and does more damage. haven't yet found utility for using second combo over it. even the subsequent combo is better than both
[^25]: use `jB > j2C > jC` sequence instead. `j2C > jB > jC` makes it much harder than it has to be for almost no reward. input super pretty quickly after wall bounce and it's a pretty easy combo with great damage at range. _kiri ender: 3485 dmg_ without last hit (air tech)
[^26]: not sure why to ever do the combo listed prior instead of this one, which does more damage for no cost, and virtually equal difficulty
[^27]: `214B+D` sideswaps. _4118_ for sameside variant
[^28]: stay in stance for first part. `214B+D` sideswaps (returning you to same side as when combo started; so technically doesn't sideswap), and does less damage, at _4021_. same-side (technically sideswap) variant does _4086_. i can't understand how `421B` routes are "more difficult here." if anything they are easier (especially staying on the same side), and not only that, but the listed combo here is more difficult, and does less damage. still a nice combo though, especially if you actually want to sideswap at range for some reason
[^29]: also should delay `214A`, in order to land entire ender. does more damage if you avoid stance on enders. but recommended to stay in stance for first part
[^footnote1]: if flip hits 4x instead of 3x, use subsequent combo instead (without `2C`)
[^footnote2]: if flip hits 4x instead of 3x, omit `2C`. still does more damage than listed (3300+)
[^footnote3]: _3424 dmg_ seems to be the actual number. _3469_ if stance version. regular (non-jumping) flip also works if it hits 4x instead of 3x (which it usually does), but does _3408 dmg_ and is a very tight pickup on the `66B` (you have to do the whole combo very fast, and it helps to use `jB > j2C > jC` instead of listed middle portion)
[^fn4]: pretty sure this is supposed to be `dl j214B`. and close range does _3115_
[^fn5]: you can actually just skip from `j421C` to `236A` which results in more damage (_3380_) for no GRD cost
